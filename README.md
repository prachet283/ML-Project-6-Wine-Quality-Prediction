# Wine Quality Prediction
This project aims to predict the quality of wine using machine learning techniques. We utilize a dataset from Kaggle and employ a Random Forest Classifier to make predictions.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is obtained from Kaggle and contains various physicochemical properties of red wine along with their quality ratings. You can find the dataset in repo.

# Requirements
To run this project, you need to have the following libraries installed:
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
jupyter

# Usage
Data Preprocessing
Model Training
Model Evaluation

# Results
The results of the model evaluation are 
Training Data Accuracy : 100%
Test Data Accuracy : 85%
The trained model is bit overfit but as this a simple project for learning it does not affect much

Deployment
The application is deployed using Streamlit. You can access it here = https://whwx7rd4djvybbssmelb6b.streamlit.app/
